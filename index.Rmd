In this project, based on the [County Demographic Information (CDI) dataset](https://github.com/HaolinZhong/CountyCRMPrediction/blob/main/data/cdi.csv),

  - We performed multiple linear regression and built a model predicting county-level crime rate with a county's total population, young adult proportion, poverty rate, per capita income and geographical region and hospital bed density as predictors. 
  
  - Our model has achieved a fairly accurate prediction with an RMSE of 1.16, an $R^2$ of 0.53 and an MAE of 0.90 in 10-fold cross-validation.
